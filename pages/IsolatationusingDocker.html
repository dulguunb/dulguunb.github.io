                    <h1> Isolation </h1>
                    When I develop certain projects under my personal computer, I usually try to isolate them. The reason being is that
                    the accidents will cost your personal computer to be destroyed. (for instance rm /*)
                    I used to use <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a> virtual machine through <a href="https://virt-manager.org/"> virt-manager</a>. However, this solution was a bit resource heavy
                    for my machine. Because virtual machines are usually installed as a guest OS on top of the Host-OS and it's pretty resource intensive (disclaimer: this is very simlified phrasing of what actually happens).
                    Therefore, I decided to use containers instead of VMs namely "Docker".
                    <h2>Containers</h2>
                    When you instantiate containers from an image, it doesn't install the guest OS rather it simply installs the library and utilities on top of your Host-OS using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups">cgroup</a> isolations. However,
                    we still have a similar concept to "guest OS" because the container requires a "base image" to start with. One difference between "base image" in the container and the VM "guest OS" is "base image" doesn't contain the kernel.
                    <h2>Dockerfile</h2>
                    Dockerfile is a text file that contains the snapshot of how your container should look like. People usually call it "Image".
                    The most elementary image can contain the "guest OS". For instance, I use ubuntu in for my containers. Below code shows what my usual Dockerfile looks like.
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/dulguunb/4f79ad30016acb4229fc68d39861533c.js"></script>
                    <code>FROM</code> keyword indicates what is the base image you want to use. <code>RUN</code> indicates after installing the base image, what command you want to run.
                    <code>VOLUME</code> indicates what is the volume you want to mount to the container.
                    <code>WORKDIR</code> keyword indicates, what is the first directory it will open up when execute shell in the container.
                    <br>
                    To instantiate this image, you need to build it using this command: <code> docker build -t="my_container" . </code>
                    <br>
                    -t stands for tag. Man page of "docker build" describes this:
                    <br>
                    <code>
                        -t, --tag ""
                        Repository names (and optionally with tags) to be applied to the resulting
                        image in case of success. Refer to docker-tag(1) for more information
                        about valid tag names.
                    </code>
                    <br>
                    the dot sign at the end of the command line is the directory where your Dockerfile resides in.
                    <h3>Images</h3>
                    After you finish building the image. You can see the list of images by executing this command: <code>docker image ls</code>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <code> REPOSITORY         TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED             SIZE</code>
                    <br>
                    <code> my_container        latest    45706e7e6d21   34 seconds ago      1.97GB</code>
                    
                    <h3>Containers</h3>
                    When image is ready, you can instantiate them to a container using the command below
                    <br>
                    <code>docker run -it -v "${PWD}:/root/workspace" -v /var/run/docker:/var/run/docker my_container</code>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <code> --it </code> means execute interactive shell once instantiation is finished.
                    <br>
                    <code>-v</code> with this command you can share the "Host OS" volumes with the containers. In my case I shared my current directory ${PWD} and /var/run/docker directories.
                    The reasons are that, Firstly, I can easily share the files I am working with the containers if I mount ${PWD} to the container. Secondly, sharing /var/run/docker allows you to execute docker daemon under
                    your container. It means you can run docker in docker. However if you create docker image and containers under container, the docker images and containers will still be created under your Host OS.
